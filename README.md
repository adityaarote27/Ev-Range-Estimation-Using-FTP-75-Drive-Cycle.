# 🌍 Drive Cycle Based EV Range Estimation using MATLAB

## 📌 Project Overview:
This project estimates the driving range of an Electric Vehicle (EV) using a standard drive cycle such as **UDDS (Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule)**. The model simulates real-world driving conditions by calculating the power and energy demand at each time step, based on vehicle dynamics and drivetrain efficiency. The final output is the estimated EV range based on total energy consumption.

## ⚙️ Key Features:
- Implementation of UDDS drive cycle (Speed vs Time profile)
- Vehicle longitudinal dynamics: Aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and acceleration force
- Instantaneous power and energy consumption calculation
- Inclusion of drivetrain efficiency losses
- Range estimation from energy used and available battery capacity
- MATLAB script or Simulink-based simulation

## 📈 Output Sample:
- **Battery Capacity:** 50 kWh  
- **Average Energy Consumption:** ~160 Wh/km  
- **Estimated Driving Range:** ~312.5 km (under UDDS cycle)

## 🧠 Why this project matters:
This project replicates how automotive companies test EV range under standard test procedures like UDDS, FTP-75, or WLTP. It reflects strong knowledge of EV system modeling and real-world simulation—essential for roles in electric mobility, vehicle simulation, and powertrain development.
